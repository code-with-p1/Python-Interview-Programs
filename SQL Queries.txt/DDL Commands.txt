Sure! Here's an example SQL query for each Data Definition Language (DDL) statement:

1. **CREATE TABLE**: This statement is used to create a new table in the database.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50),
       Department VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **ALTER TABLE**: This statement is used to modify an existing table schema, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns.
   
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Employees
   ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
   ```

3. **DROP TABLE**: This statement is used to delete an existing table from the database.
   
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE Employees;
   ```

4. **CREATE INDEX**: This statement is used to create an index on a table, which can improve the performance of queries.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_LastName ON Employees(LastName);
   ```

5. **DROP INDEX**: This statement is used to remove an existing index from the database.
   
   ```sql
   DROP INDEX idx_LastName;
   ```

6. **CREATE VIEW**: This statement is used to create a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW EmployeeNames AS
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
   ```

7. **DROP VIEW**: This statement is used to delete an existing view from the database.
   
   ```sql
   DROP VIEW EmployeeNames;
   ```

8. **CREATE DATABASE**: This statement is used to create a new database.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
   ```

9. **DROP DATABASE**: This statement is used to delete an existing database from the server.
   
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE CompanyDB;
   ```

These are some basic examples of SQL queries for each DDL statement.
