Certainly! Here's an example SQL query for each Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement:

1. **INSERT INTO**: This statement is used to insert new records into a table.
   
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)
   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'Sales');
   ```

2. **UPDATE**: This statement is used to modify existing records in a table.
   
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees
   SET Department = 'Marketing'
   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
   ```

3. **DELETE FROM**: This statement is used to delete existing records from a table.
   
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM Employees
   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
   ```

4. **SELECT**: Although it's commonly considered part of the Data Query Language (DQL), it's also a part of DML since it manipulates data, albeit by selecting it.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees
   WHERE Department = 'Marketing';
   ```

These are some basic examples of SQL queries for each Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement.
